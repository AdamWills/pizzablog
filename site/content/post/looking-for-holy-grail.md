I love pizza.

My first job was at a pizza place. It was at an independant business in a small town during my high school and college years. We made our dough from scratch every day, used fresh ingredients and used a stone oven to bring the pizza to life.

I was already a big fan of pizza before starting there, but it's during this time that I really fell in love. There was something about the process of making pizza that really connected with me. Getting to understand the dough; experimenting with toppings and combinations; and balancing an oven full of pizza to ensure everything is baked to perfection &mdash; each step is no more or less important than another.

However, the best part of working at a pizza place? Eating pizza. Of course.

I was there over 5 years, and there was never a day where I thought, "you know what? I think I'm tired of pizza today." I still consider pizza to be my go-to meal in any situation, and in recent years the excitement has come back.

Moving to Hamilton in 2014 opened up the doors to so many new pizza places. So, of course, the first question I had to ask was… "Where does the best pizza in Hamilton come from?"

This really is an impossible question to answer. Everyone has their favourites, and it's hard to compare different styles of pizza against each other. There's places that people have grown up with; new places that are fresh and exciting; and there's something to be said for the place around the corner that "feels like home."

Within the pages of this site, I'll do my best to point out some of the pizza gems in Hamilton. It's all subjective of course, but at the very least, this will be reason to venture from my neighbourhood with some friends and enjoy all the pizza that this city has to offer.
